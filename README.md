# Solidity Merkle Tree Example

## What is this?

It's a skeleton for a Merkle Tree implementation in Solidity, designed to help people practice their Solidity skills and simultaneously learn about Merkle Trees.
Noice!

I've chosen to use hardhat here because I use hardhat at work and I think it's the best Solidity development framework right now.
You should get familiar with how to write tests in hardhat if you want to write Solidity code for a living.

Note that this is currently a work in progress as part of my EthernautDAO mentorship program.

## Why Merkle Trees?

I've had to make use of Merkle Trees in almost every Ethereum-related project that I've worked on.
You will probably have to do the same.
It's also the sort of thing that I would quiz people on if hiring for a Solidity role, so I highly recommend that prospective Solidity developers learn how to implement a Merkle Tree verification function in Solidity.

## How do I get started?

I'll fill this section out later.

If you're reading this before I fill this section out, just try to fill out MerkleTree.sol and make the tests inside MerkleTree.spec.ts pass.


yarn add hardhat ethers ethereum-waffle @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle --dev

yarn add mocha chai --dev

yarn add typescript ts-node @types/node @types/mocha @types/chai --dev
